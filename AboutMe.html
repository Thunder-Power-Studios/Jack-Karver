<p>Ahoy there, mates! I'm Jack Karver, a space taxi captain and entrepreneur. I am the proud owner of one spaceship and two ground vehicles, and I am a member of the esteemed Varyag Crew. I will not call myself a captain until I captain a mothership or privateer. Though I run three businesses, including Healing, Taxi's, and DPS, I still have a long way to go before I can achieve my ultimate dream of owning a mothership. Despite what you may think, I am far from rich, and I struggle to make ends meet on a daily basis. I have less than 10 PED in my ped card and less than 100 PED worth of stuff in my inventory. If you're feeling generous, please consider tipping or donating to help me achieve my goals. I may not have much, but I am not a greedy man, and I will take anything that comes my way. Thank you for your support, and may the winds of fortune always be at your back!</p>
