<p>Hello mates, I'm Jack Karver. I captain one spaceship + two ground vechiles which i own. I will not call myself a captian intill I captain a mothership or privateer. I am part of the Varyag Crew. I run 3 buessnesses, healing,taxi, and dps. My dream is to own a mothership. If you think oh this mate is rich becasue he has a lot of buessness. Well mate, your wrong,i struggle to buy everthing. I have less then 10 PED in my ped card and less the 100 PED worth of stuff in my invantory. That said if you want to help me out please tip me or donate. I'm not greedy.
